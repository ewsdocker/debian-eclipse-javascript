NOTE: If the _New Version_ version number is not in the **Tags**, the **latest** tag is still under test.  Testing will be complete when the _New Version_ tag exists.

Other Docker versions (or tags) can be selected on the Docker [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-javascript/tags/) page.  

An explanation of the [Docker Tags](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-javascript/wiki/DockerTags) is available on the [ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-javascript Wiki](https://github.com/ewsdocker/debian-eclipse-javascript/wiki).
